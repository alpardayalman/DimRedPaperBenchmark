# Dimension Reduction Benchmarking Guide

This guide provides comprehensive strategies for benchmarking dimension reduction algorithms and evaluating their effectiveness for your research paper.

## Overview

The dimension reduction toolkit provides a comprehensive benchmarking framework that evaluates algorithms across multiple dimensions:

1. **Structure Preservation** - How well the algorithm preserves local and global structure
2. **Clustering Quality** - How well the reduced data supports clustering tasks
3. **Classification Performance** - How well the reduced data supports classification tasks
4. **Visualization Quality** - How effective the reduced data is for visualization
5. **Computational Efficiency** - Time and memory requirements

## Benchmarking Strategies

### 1. Structure Preservation Metrics

Structure preservation is crucial for understanding how well an algorithm maintains the relationships between data points.

#### Local Structure Metrics
- **Neighborhood Preservation**: Measures how well local neighborhoods are preserved
- **Trustworthiness**: Evaluates if points close in reduced space were close in original space
- **Local Structure Score**: Combined local structure assessment

#### Global Structure Metrics
- **Continuity**: Measures if points close in original space remain close in reduced space
- **Stress**: Kruskal's stress measure for distance preservation
- **Shepard Correlation**: Correlation between original and reduced distances
- **Global Structure Score**: Combined global structure assessment

#### Multi-scale Analysis
```python
from src.benchmarking import StructurePreservation

structure_metrics = StructurePreservation()
multiscale_results = structure_metrics.compute_multiscale_structure_analysis(
    X_original, X_reduced, neighbor_counts=[5, 10, 20, 50]
)
```

### 2. Downstream Task Performance

Evaluate how well the reduced embeddings support common machine learning tasks.

#### Clustering Quality
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures cluster separation and compactness
- **Calinski-Harabasz Index**: Ratio of between-cluster to within-cluster dispersion
- **Davies-Bouldin Index**: Average similarity measure of clusters
- **Cluster Separation Score**: Distance between cluster centroids
- **Cluster Compactness Score**: Within-cluster distances

#### Classification Performance
- **Accuracy**: Overall classification accuracy
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Precision & Recall**: Per-class performance metrics
- **ROC AUC**: Area under the ROC curve
- **Cross-validation**: Robust performance estimation

#### Multiple Classifiers
```python
from src.benchmarking import ClassificationQuality

class_metrics = ClassificationQuality()
classifier_performance = class_metrics.compute_classifier_performance(X_reduced, y)
```

### 3. Visualization Quality

Assess how effective the reduced data is for visualization purposes.

#### Class-based Metrics
- **Class Separation**: Distance between class centroids
- **Class Compactness**: Within-class distances
- **Inter-class Distance**: Average distance between classes
- **Intra-class Distance**: Average distance within classes
- **Class Overlap**: Degree of overlap between classes

#### Spatial Distribution
- **Point Density Score**: Uniformity of point distribution
- **Spatial Distribution Score**: Grid-based distribution analysis

### 4. Computational Efficiency

Measure the computational requirements of each algorithm.

#### Timing Analysis
```python
import time

timing_results = {}
for method in methods:
    start_time = time.time()
    embedding = reducer.fit_transform(X, method=method)
    elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    timing_results[method] = {
        'training_time': elapsed_time,
        'embedding_shape': embedding.shape,
        'reduction_ratio': X.shape[1] / embedding.shape[1]
    }
```

#### Memory Usage
- Monitor peak memory consumption during training
- Compare memory requirements across algorithms
- Consider scalability with dataset size

## Comprehensive Evaluation Workflow

### Step 1: Data Preparation
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs

# Generate or load your data
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=1000, n_features=50, centers=5, random_state=42)

# Standardize the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

### Step 2: Apply Dimension Reduction
```python
from src.dimension_reduction import DimensionReducer

reducer = DimensionReducer()
embeddings = {}

methods = ['pca', 'tsne', 'umap']
for method in methods:
    embeddings[method.upper()] = reducer.fit_transform(
        X_scaled, method=method, n_components=2
    )
```

### Step 3: Run Comprehensive Benchmark
```python
from src.benchmarking import BenchmarkSuite

benchmark = BenchmarkSuite(random_state=42)
results = benchmark.evaluate_all(X_scaled, embeddings, y_labels=y)
```

### Step 4: Analyze Results
```python
# Generate summary report
summary = results['summary']
print("Best methods by category:")
for category, method in summary['best_methods'].items():
    print(f"  {category}: {method}")

# Generate detailed report
report_df = benchmark.generate_report(results)
print(report_df.round(4))
```

## Advanced Benchmarking Strategies

### 1. Dataset Diversity

Test algorithms on diverse datasets to understand their strengths and weaknesses:

- **Synthetic Datasets**: Controlled experiments with known structure
- **Real-world Datasets**: Practical applications and challenges
- **High-dimensional Data**: Test scalability and performance
- **Noisy Data**: Evaluate robustness to noise

### 2. Parameter Sensitivity Analysis

Evaluate how sensitive algorithms are to parameter choices:

```python
# Test different parameter settings
umap_params = [
    {'n_neighbors': 5, 'min_dist': 0.1},
    {'n_neighbors': 15, 'min_dist': 0.1},
    {'n_neighbors': 30, 'min_dist': 0.1},
    {'n_neighbors': 15, 'min_dist': 0.01},
    {'n_neighbors': 15, 'min_dist': 0.5}
]

for params in umap_params:
    embedding = reducer.fit_transform(X, method='umap', **params)
    # Evaluate and compare results
```

### 3. Statistical Significance Testing

Use statistical tests to determine if performance differences are significant:

```python
from scipy import stats

# Compare two methods
method1_scores = [0.85, 0.87, 0.83, 0.86, 0.84]
method2_scores = [0.82, 0.84, 0.81, 0.83, 0.82]

t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_rel(method1_scores, method2_scores)
print(f"p-value: {p_value:.4f}")
```

### 4. Cross-validation for Robust Evaluation

Use cross-validation to get more reliable performance estimates:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold

cv_scores = []
kf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

for train_idx, test_idx in kf.split(X):
    X_train, X_test = X[train_idx], X[test_idx]
    y_train, y_test = y[train_idx], y[test_idx]
    
    # Fit on training data
    embedding_train = reducer.fit_transform(X_train, method='umap')
    
    # Evaluate on test data
    # (Note: t-SNE doesn't support out-of-sample transformation)
    score = evaluate_embedding(embedding_train, y_train)
    cv_scores.append(score)

print(f"CV Score: {np.mean(cv_scores):.4f} Â± {np.std(cv_scores):.4f}")
```

## Paper-Ready Analysis

### 1. Comparative Tables

Create comprehensive comparison tables:

| Method | Structure Score | Clustering Score | Classification Score | Visualization Score | Overall Score |
|--------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| PCA    | 0.75           | 0.68            | 0.82               | 0.71              | 0.74          |
| t-SNE  | 0.89           | 0.91            | 0.78               | 0.95              | 0.88          |
| UMAP   | 0.92           | 0.94            | 0.85               | 0.93              | 0.91          |

### 2. Visualization Analysis

Create publication-ready visualizations:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 3, figsize=(15, 10))

# Plot embeddings
for i, (method, embedding) in enumerate(embeddings.items()):
    row, col = i // 3, i % 3
    ax = axes[row, col]
    
    scatter = ax.scatter(embedding[:, 0], embedding[:, 1], c=y, cmap='viridis', alpha=0.7)
    ax.set_title(f'{method}')
    ax.set_xlabel('Component 1')
    ax.set_ylabel('Component 2')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('embeddings_comparison.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
```

### 3. Statistical Analysis

Include statistical analysis in your paper:

- **Effect sizes**: Quantify the magnitude of differences
- **Confidence intervals**: Provide uncertainty estimates
- **Multiple comparisons**: Account for testing multiple hypotheses
- **Effectiveness ranking**: Rank methods by overall performance

### 4. Ablation Studies

Conduct ablation studies to understand component contributions:

```python
# Test different components of the evaluation
components = ['structure', 'clustering', 'classification', 'visualization']
ablation_results = {}

for component in components:
    # Evaluate with only this component
    score = evaluate_single_component(embeddings, component)
    ablation_results[component] = score
```
